## Abstract

Brazil is a country with large renewable energy potential.
In this report, we explore the potential for wind energy in Brazil.
Using the tools of geospatial data science,
we connect meteorological, demographic, topological, and infrastructure data to better understand this potential.
We find that wind energy is a viable option for Brazil,
and that the country has the potential to become a world leader in wind energy production.

## Introduction

Wind energy is a renewable energy source that has been growing in popularity in recent years.


## Literature Review

@zhang2015 @abdalla2022 write something here. @yu2022 is cool as well. @winkler2012 can't go without mentioning (@ulak2019).


### Wind Energy

Wind energy is a renewable energy source that has been growing in popularity in recent years.
There are many reasons for this growth. Part of it is the exsitance of large investments funds such as
[Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP)](https://www.cipartners.dk/), which has invested in wind energy projects
in Brazil. Another reason is the increasing efficiency of wind turbines, which has made wind energy more
economically viable. Finally, the increasing concern about climate change has led to a push for renewable energy
sources, such as wind energy.

### Brazil

Brazil is a country with large renewable energy potential. It has a large coastline, which makes it a good
candidate for offshore wind energy. It also has a large land area, which makes it a good candidate for onshore
wind energy. Finally, it has a large population, which makes it a good candidate for wind energy.

Political and economic factors does complicate the situation. Brazil has a history of political instability,
which makes it difficult to invest in long-term projects. In addition, Brazil is quite polarized politically,
with recent administrations being anti-environmentalist. Finally, Brazil has a history of corruption, which
makes it difficult to invest in long-term projects; complicated legal systems; and a lack of transparency.

However, Brazil is in many ways also on the forefront of environmentalism, having played an important role in
the Paris Agreement and having a large renewable energy sector. Al Gore has called Brazil "a leader in the
global effort to combat climate change". Alfredo Sirkis, a Brazilian politician and environmentalist, has
called Brazil "the most important country in the world for the future of the environment".
